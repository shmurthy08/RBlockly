## Installation

Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html) and [RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html#rstudio) prior to installing the project. The project can be run by referencing our GitHub Pages link: [GitHub Link](https://shmurthy08.github.io/RBlockly/src/design-blocks/index.html).

While, you don't have to install RStudio because the `index.html` file enables R code to be run on the HTML page itself (using [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/)). There is no need to install WebR for this project, if you need to copy/download the R code then only do you need to install RStudio.

 
## Reproduce Demo Locally

**NOTE:** If there are changes on the GitHub pages feel free to fetch this repository and open the `src/index.html` file in your browser.
 
To reproduce the project, follow the steps below:
1. Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html) and [RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html#rstudio)
2. Follow Installation steps above
3. Drag and drop code blocks to create your code
4. Download code
    - Click on Generate Code and then click on Download
    - Open file on RStudio and Run the file
5. Enjoy!

## Reproduce Demo - Using GitHub Pages

1. [Open GitHub Pages link](https://shmurthy08.github.io/RBlockly/src/design-blocks/index.html)
2. Click on `Generate R Code` button as blocks have already been pre-rendered to run the demo
3. Click on the `Run R Code` button
4. Enjoy!

## Extending the Project

1. Fork the repository
2. `git clone` the forked repository
3. cd into the RBlockly/src directory for that repository that was cloned
4. Make your new features
5. Publish edits to FORKED repository
6. Make a Pull Request with the main repository (shmurthy08/RBlockly)
7. Wait for changes to be pulled
8. IF NEEDED: make git issues such that original owners of the main repository can make changes

## Usage

Use this project to learn more about R and how blocks can be used to promote understanding and education of the language.
